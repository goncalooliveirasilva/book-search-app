# Simple Book Search App

This is a small project I built when I started learning JavaScript.
It uses the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search) to let users search for books and view basic details.

The project was developed using **HTML**, **CSS** and **Vanilla JavaScript**.

Although it's unfinished, I'm keeping it public for future reference.

## Features

- Search for books using the Open Library API
- View book details (title, author, publish year, etc.)
- Change user name in a simple profile section
- (Planned) Add books to favourites - partially implemented

## Status

**Unfinished**
- The "add to favorites" feature is incomplete
- UI is minimal and mostly for learning purposes

## Note

This project is part of my early learning experience with JavaScript and programming in general.
